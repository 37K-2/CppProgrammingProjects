# CppProgrammingProjects

This repository contains projects for my C++ class, in addition to a few other projects I've made in between actual assignments.  Projects that are for assignments will be obvious; the README in each directory tells you if the project is for an assignment or not.
Please don't skid these projects.  Not because it's stealing code, but because it's honestly bad code and idk if I'm doing anything right. xD
